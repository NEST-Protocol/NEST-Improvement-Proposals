## Abstract

Update the system income reward model, the system income rewards can be claimed anytime and based on the total staking duration. Unclaimed rewards can be collect even after the weekly claiming cut-off time.

## Motivation

Increase the fairness of the system income rewards model. At the moment, the claimable share of rewards is not based on the total staking time duration. The current model could provide more advantage/incentive to the short term NEST staker instead of the long-term one.

Also, this proposal proposes to remove the mandatory weekly claim so that the rewards could be claimed even after the cut-off time.
